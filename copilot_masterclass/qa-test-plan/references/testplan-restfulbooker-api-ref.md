Objective 

The objective of this test plan is to basically verify the RESTful Booker API, where we have created booking, updated booking, delete booking with authentication, add authentication token. It basically contains a lot of bugs also. We need to find all those bugs. That's the overall objective. We are going to put them all into a Postman for test case execution. And in the end, we need automation also for the same by using REST assured framework.

Defect Reporting Procedure

The criteria for identifying a defect, such as deviation from the requirements, user experience issues, or technical errors.

The steps for reporting a defect, such as using a designated template, providing detailed reproduction steps, and attaching screenshots or logs.

The process for triaging and prioritizing defects, such as assigning severity and priority levels, and assigning them to the appropriate team members for investigation and resolution.

The tools and systems that will be used for tracking and managing defects, such as a defect tracking software or a project management tool.

The roles and responsibilities of the team members involved in the defect reporting process, such as testers, developers, and the test lead.

The communication channels and frequencies for updating stakeholders on the progress and status of defects.

The metrics and metrics that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the defect reporting process, such as the number of defects found, the time taken to resolve them, and the percentage of defects that were successfully fixed.

Test Strategy

The first step is to create test scenarios and test cases for the various features in
Scope.

While developing test cases, we'll use a number of test design techniques.
o Equivalence Class Partition
o Boundary Value Analysis
o Decision Table Testing
o State Transition Testing
o Use Case Testing


 We also use our expertise in creating Test Cases by applying the below:
o Error Guessing
o Exploratory Testing
• We prioritize the Test Cases


Step 2: Our testing procedure when we receive a request for testing:


• First, we'll conduct smoke testing to see if the various and
important functionalities of the application are working.

• We reject the build, if the Smoke Testing fails and will wait for the stable
build before performing in depth testing of the application functionalities.

• Once we receive a stable build, which passes Smoke Testing, we perform
in depth testing using the Test Cases created.


• Multiple Test Resources will be testing the same Application on Multiple
Supported Environments simultaneously.


We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send dev. management
the defect found on that day in a status end of the day email.


As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing:
o Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing
o Regression Testing and Retesting
o Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing
• We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product.



Step3 –  We will follow the below best practices to make our Testing better:

• Context Driven Testing – We will be performing Testing as per the context
of the given application.


• Shift Left Testing – We will start testing from the beginning stages of the
development itself, instead of waiting for the stable build.


• Exploratory Testing – Using our expertise we will perform Exploratory
Testing, apart from the normal execution of the Test cases.


• End to End Flow Testing – We will test the end-to-end scenario which
involve multiple functionalities to simulate the end user flows.
